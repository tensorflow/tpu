# Cloud TPUs #

This repository is a collection of reference models and tools used with
[Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/).

The fastest way to get started training a model on a Cloud TPU is by following
the tutorial. Click the button below to launch the tutorial using Google Cloud
Shell.

## Running Models

To run models in the `models` subdirectory, you may need to add the top-level
`/models` folder to the Python path with the command:

```
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/models"
```

## Hosted APIs

</p>

Alternatively, you can experiment with models through hosted infrastructure:

- For all tensorflow models hosted on [Tiyaro.ai](https://console.tiyaro.ai/explore?q=tensorflow&pub=tensorflow)
  - Or specifically for [EfficientNet on Tiyaro.ai](https://console.tiyaro.ai/explore?q=efficientnet&pub=tensorflow)
  - Or specifically for [RCNN on Tiyaro.ai](https://console.tiyaro.ai/explore?q=rcnn&pub=tensorflow)
