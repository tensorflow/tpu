# Train ResNet-50 with fake ImageNet dataset using Cloud TPU and Google
# Kubernetes Engine.
#
# The tutorial is at https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-engine-resnet.
#
# [Training Data]
#   In this example, we use randomly generated fake ImageNet dataset at
#   gs://cloud-tpu-test-datasets/fake_imagenet as the training data.
#
# [Instructions]
#   1. Follow the instructions on https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/kubernetes-engine-setup
#      to create a Kubernetes Engine cluster.
#   2. Change the environment variable MODEL_BUCKET in the Job spec to the
#      Google Cloud Storage location where you want to store the output model.
#   3. Run `kubectl create -f resnet_k8s.yaml`.
