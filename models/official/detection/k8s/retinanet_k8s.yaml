# Train RetinaNet with COCO dataset using Cloud TPU and Google Kubernetes
# Engine.
#
# [Training Data]
#   Download and preprocess the COCO dataset using https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/blob/r1.13/tools/datasets/download_and_preprocess_coco_k8s.yaml
#   if you don't already have the data.
#
# [Instructions]
#   1. Follow the instructions on https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/kubernetes-engine-setup
#      to create a Kubernetes Engine cluster.
#   2. Change the environment variable TRAIN_FILE_PATTERN and MODEL_BUCKET below to the
#      Google Cloud Storage location where you downloaded the COCO dataset and
#      where you want to store the output model, respectively. For running eval as well
#      VAL_JSON_FILE and EVAL_FILE_PATTERN.
#   3. Run `kubectl create -f retinanet_k8s.yaml`.
