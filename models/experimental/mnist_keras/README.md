# Keras TPU Integration #

This directory contains examples of using the experimental Cloud TPU-Keras
integration that was added in TF 1.9. To learn more about this new integration,
check out the documentation (coming soon!).

## MNIST ##

This is a simple sequential convolutional network to recognize handwritten
digits. This is a simple example of how to use the new Keras integration.
