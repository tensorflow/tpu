# CTPU: The Cloud TPU Provisioning Utility #

`ctpu` is a tool that helps you set up a Cloud TPU. It
is focused on supporting data scientists using Cloud TPUs for their research and
model development.

There are 4 main subcommands to know when using `ctpu`:

 - **status**: `ctpu status` will query the GCP APIs to determine the current
   status of your Cloud TPU and GCE VM.
 - **up**: `ctpu up` will create a GCE VM with TensorFlow pre-installed, and
   create a corresponding Cloud TPU. If necessary, it will enable the
   appropriate GCP APIs, and configure default access levels. Finally, it will
   `ssh` into your GCE VM so you're all ready to start developing!
 - **pause**: `ctpu pause` will stop your GCE VM, and delete your Cloud TPU. Use
   this command when you'd like to go to lunch or when you're done for the night
   to save money. (No need to pay for a Cloud TPU or GCE VM if you're not using
   them.) When you're ready to get back going again, just run `ctpu up`, and
   you can pick back up right where you left off! *Note: you will still be
   charged for the disk space consumed by your GCE VM while it's paused.*
 - **delete**: `ctpu delete` will delete your GCE VM and Cloud TPU. Use this
   command if you're done using Cloud TPUs for a while or want to clean up your
   allocated resources.

> Pro tip: `ctpu` makes simplifying assumptions on your behalf and thus may not
> be suitable for power users. For example, if you're executing a parallel
> hyperparameter search, consider scripting calls to `gcloud` instead.

## Install `ctpu` ##

You can get started using `ctpu` in one of two ways:

1. Using Google Cloud Shell (**recommended**). This is the fastest and easiest
   way to get started, and comes with a tutorial to walk you through all the
   steps.
2. Using your local machine. You can download and run `ctpu` on your local
   machine

Follow the appropriate instructions below to get started.

### Cloud Shell ###

Click on the button below to follow a tutorial that will walk you through
getting everything set up.

### Local Machine ###

Alternatively, you can also use `ctpu` from your local machine. Follow the
instructions below to install and configure `ctpu` locally.

#### Download ####

Download `ctpu` with one of following commands:

 * **Linux**: `wget https://dl.google.com/cloud_tpu/ctpu/latest/linux/ctpu && chmod a+x ctpu`
 * **Mac**: `wget https://dl.google.com/cloud_tpu/ctpu/latest/darwin/ctpu && chmod a+x ctpu`
 * **Windows**: _Coming soon!_

#### Install ####

While you can use `ctpu` in your local directory (by prefixing all commands with
`./`; ex: `./ctpu print-config`), we recommend installing it somewhere on your
`$PATH`. (e.g. `cp ctpu ~/bin` to install for just yourself,
`sudo cp ctpu /usr/bin` for all users of your machine.)

#### Configuration ####

In order to use `ctpu` you need to provide it with a bit of additional
information.

 1. **Configure `gcloud` credentials**: If you have never used `gcloud` before,
    you will need to configure it. Run `gcloud auth login` to allocated
    credentials for `gcloud` to use when operating on your behalf.
 2. **Configure `ctpu` credentials**: `ctpu` uses the "application default"
    credentials set up by the Google SDK. In order to allocate your application
    default credentials, run: `gcloud auth application-default login`.
 3. **Configure project & zone** (optional): In order to avoid having to specify
    the GCP project and zone every time you run `ctpu`, you can set default
    values by running `gcloud config set project $PROJECT` and
    `gcloud config set compute/zone $ZONE`, substituting `$PROJECT` and `$ZONE`
    with your desired project and zone. If you are using multiple projects, you
    can group your default values using `gcloud config configurations`.

## Usage Details ##

### Global Flags ###

There are a few flags common to all subcommands. These "global" flags are placed
before the subcommand. For example: `ctpu -name=saeta-2 config` (where
`-name=saeta2` is the global flag, and `config` is the subcommand). The most
common global flag is the `-name` flag. Use the `-name` flag when you'd like to
have multiple independent workspaces in the same GCP project, or if `ctpu`
doesn't guess a useful name. (`ctpu` defaults to naming your VM + TPU pair
(also referred to as a Cloud TPU flock) after your username.)

> Note: All flags can also be "double-dash" prefixed. (e.g. `--name=foo`)

#### Common GCE Configuration ####

While it's possible to use global flags to define the GCP project and GCE zone
you'd like to allocate your Cloud TPU and VMs in, it's often easier to use
`gcloud`'s built-in configuration system. If you didn't set a default
configuration when you installed gcloud, you can set (or reset) one using the
following commands:

```
gcloud config set project $MY_PROJECT
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-c
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
```

If you'd like to maintain multiple independent configurations (e.g you're
using GCP for a personal project, and a project at work), you can use the
`gcloud config configurations` subcommand to manage multiple independent
configurations. `ctpu` will use the currently active configuration
automatically.

### Getting help ###

If you're ever confused on how to use the `ctpu` tool, you can always run
`ctpu help` to get a print out of the major usage documentation. If you'd like
to learn more about a particular subcommand, run `ctpu help $SUBCOMMAND` (for
example: `ctpu help up`). If you'd simply like a list of all the available
subcommands, simply execute `ctpu commands`.

If you're having problems getting your credentials right, use the `ctpu print-config`
command to print out the configuration `ctpu` would use when creating your Cloud
TPU and GCE VM.

## Security Documentation ##

The `ctpu` tool focuses on user egonomics, and thus automatically selects
reasonable defaults that are expected to work for the majority of users. We
document these choices that are potentially security related here as well as
how to customize the security posture.

 - **Port Forwarding**: In order to make tools like [`tensorboard`](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard)
   work out of the box, `ctpu` automatically configures port forwarding over the
   ssh tunnel to your GCE VM. If you'd like to disable port forarding, add the
   `--forward-ports=false` flag to `ctpu up`. Example:

   ```
   ctpu up --forward-ports=false
   ```

 - **IAM & Service Management**: A Cloud TPU typically reads data from (and
   saves checkpoints to) [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/). A Cloud
   TPU also outputs logs to
   [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). By default, Cloud
   TPUs have no permissions on your project. The `ctpu` tool automatically sets
   up the Cloud TPU's permissions to output TensorFlow logs to your project, and
   allows the Cloud TPU to read all storage buckets in our project. However, if
   `ctpu` sees that your Cloud TPU already has _some_ access pre-configured, it
   will make no changes.

 - **SSH Agent Forwarding**: When ssh-ing into the GCE VM, `ctpu` supports SSH
   Agent forwarding. When working with non-public repositories (e.g. private
   GitHub repositories), credentials are required to clone the source tree. SSH
   Agent forwarding allows users to forward their credentials from their local
   machine to the GCE VM to avoid persisting credentials on the GCE VM. If you
   would like to disable SSH Agent Forwarding, pass the `--forward-agent=false`
   flag when executing `ctpu up`. Example:

   ```
   ctpu up --forward-agent=false
   ```

## Current limitations of ctpu ##

 - **Multiple Accounts**: `ctpu` cannot correctly handle if you use multiple
   Google accounts across different projects. (e.g. `alice@example.com` for work
   and `alice@gmail.com` for personal development.) Instead, please use `ctpu`
   in Google Cloud Shell where you will have a different shell environment for
   each account.
 - **Name restrictions**: In order to prevent clashes, we require that all
   flock names are longer than 2 characters. If your username is 2 characters or
   less, you will have to manually set a flock name on the command line with the
   `-name` global flag.
 - **TF version**: When `ctpu` creates a Cloud TPU and GCE VM, it creates the VM
   with the latest stable TensorFlow version. When new TensorFlow versions are
   released, you must upgrade the installed TensorFlow on your VMs, or
   delete your GCE VM (after appropriately saving your work!) and re-create it
   using `ctpu up`.

### Bug Reports ###

If you encounter a reproducible issue with `ctpu`, please do file a bug report!
It will be most helpful if you include:

 1. The full output when running the command with the `-log-http` global flag
    set to true
 2. The output of `ctpu print-config`, `ctpu version`, and `ctpu list` both before
    and after the failing command.
 3. Steps to reproduce the issue on a clean GCP project.

### Developing ###

The code is layed out in the following packages:

 - **`config`**: This package contains the tool-wide configuration, such as (1)
   the credentials used to communicate with GCP, (2) desired zone, and (3) the
   desired flock name.
 - **`ctrl`**: This package contains the thin wrappers around the
   [Google API Go SDK](https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client). For
   details on the SDK, see the godocs for
   [GCE](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/compute/v1) and
   [Cloud TPUs](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/tpu/v1alpha1).
 - **`commands`**: This package contains the business logic for all subcommands.
 - **`main`**: The main package ties everything together.

In order to keep the code organized, dependencies are only allowed on packages
above the current package in the list. Concretely, the `commands` package can
depend on `ctrl` and `config`, but `config` cannot depend on `ctrl`.

Contributed code must conform to the Golang style guide, and follow Go best
practices. Additionally, all contributions should include unit tests in order
to ensure there are no regressions in functionality in the future. Unit tests
must not depend on anything in the environment, and must not make any network
connections.

#### Developer Workflow ####

`ctpu` is developed as a standard [go](https://golang.org/) project. To check
out the code for development purposes, execute:

```
go get -t github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tools/ctpu/...
go test github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tools/ctpu/...
```

Once you're in this directory, you can use `go build` and `go test`.
